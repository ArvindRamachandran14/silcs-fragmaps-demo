I am staring a project to build an Interactive Visualization Demo for P38 MAP Kinase (PDB: 3FLY) Using SILCS FragMaps. The SILCS FragMaps technology has been developed by the company SilcsBio (url - https://silcsbio.com).

This project is part of their interview process for a the Applications Scientist -- Scientific Software Development role. I have the instructions for this project in the file docs/SilcsBio\_Candidate\_Exercise\_Instructions.pdf

I want to start by creating a product requirement document (prd) and the instructions file is a good starting point. Please convert it to a .md file and put it in docs. I will then edit the prd to clarify the goals of the project.
