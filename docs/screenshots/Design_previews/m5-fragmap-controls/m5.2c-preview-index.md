# M5.2c Preview Index - Wireframe Parity Tuning

## M5.2c Scope Lock
- `M5.2c` only.
- Prompt type: `Prompt A` (design preview only).
- Goal: tune wireframe rendering appearance for closer parity with approved/reference SILCS snapshots.
- Preserve all behavior contracts from `M5.1`-`M5.2b`.

Out of scope:
- Any map/protein/ligand control behavior changes.
- Any map ID, label, color mapping, or default iso-value changes.
- Any `M5.3+` behavior (Advanced/Exclusion runtime behavior, per-map iso controls runtime, bulk actions runtime, reliability hardening).

## Required State Coverage
- Default
- Loading
- Empty
- Error
- Success

## Artifacts
- `desktop/m5.2c-wireframe-parity-states.svg` (created)

## Reference Inputs for Parity Review
- `docs/screenshots/GUI/GUI_3fly_ligand_apolar_fragmap.png`
- `docs/screenshots/Bugs/3fly_ligand_fragmaps_apolar.png`

## Gate Checklist
- [x] One M5.2c page exists in packet (`default/loading/empty/error/success` covered).
- [x] Scope is constrained to rendering-parameter parity tuning only.
- [x] No control/behavior changes are depicted in this slice preview.
- [x] Front page and approval log are updated for M5.2c gate tracking.

## Open UI Questions
1. Should M5.2c runtime tuning target only `Generic Apolar` parity first, or tune all Primary-3 rows in the same pass?
2. For parity, should occluded/far-field wireframe edges remain subdued or be made equally prominent?

## Approval State
- `APPROVED UI PREVIEW` (explicit token received in-thread on 2026-02-16)
