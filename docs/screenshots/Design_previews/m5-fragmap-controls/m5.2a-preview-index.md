# M5.2a Preview Index - Wireframe Rendering Pass

## M5.2a Scope Lock
- `M5.2a` only.
- Includes rendering-style conversion preview:
  - triangulated wireframe rendering for all FragMaps,
  - fixed gray triangulated wireframe rendering for `Exclusion Map`.
- Excludes behavior additions in `M5.3+`:
  - no new Advanced/Exclusion logic,
  - no per-map iso controls,
  - no bulk-action behavior changes,
  - no reliability/retry behavior changes.

## Coverage Checklist
- [x] `Default` state: no visible FragMaps, wireframe style legend shown.
- [x] `Loading` state: M5.2 loading-lock behavior preserved; wireframe is target render result after resolve.
- [x] `Empty` state: all maps hidden; cached rows remain eligible for wireframe rendering on next toggle-on.
- [x] `Error` state: row-level load failure remains non-blocking; unaffected rows still render as wireframe.
- [x] `Success` state: visible FragMaps shown in triangulated wireframe style, including fixed gray `Exclusion Map` wireframe.
- [x] Right-panel framework remains aligned to approved shell (`FragMap` active, `Ligand` sibling tab).
- [x] Scope is constrained to rendering-style conversion only (no M5.3+ behavior shown).

## Artifact Matrix
| State | Artifact | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Default | `desktop/m5.2a-wireframe-rendering-states.svg` (Panel A) | All rows unchecked; style swatch legend clarifies wireframe contract |
| Loading | `desktop/m5.2a-wireframe-rendering-states.svg` (Panel B) | Existing load-lock behavior retained; wireframe is target resolved style |
| Empty | `desktop/m5.2a-wireframe-rendering-states.svg` (Panel C) | Zero visible maps with cache-preservation note |
| Error | `desktop/m5.2a-wireframe-rendering-states.svg` (Panel D) | Row-scoped failure remains isolated; unaffected wireframe row remains visible |
| Success | `desktop/m5.2a-wireframe-rendering-states.svg` (Panel E) | Triangulated wireframe rendering shown for Primary rows + `Exclusion Map` |

## Open UI Questions
1. Wireframe line weight and occlusion handling are accepted for this slice by `APPROVED UI PREVIEW`; any fine-tuning can be treated as post-M5.2a polish if needed.

## Traceability
- Plan refs: `docs/plans/execution-plan.md` Sections `1.3`, `3`, and `3.1` (`M5.2a`).
- Spec refs: `docs/specs/fragmap-controls-spec.md` Sections `8.1`, `8.2`, `10`, and `13`.

## Approval State
- Current: `APPROVED UI PREVIEW`
- Prompt-B implementation is unblocked for `M5.2a`.
