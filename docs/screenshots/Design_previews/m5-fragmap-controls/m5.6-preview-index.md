# M5.6 Preview Index - Reliability Hardening + Final M5 Gate

## M5.6 Scope Lock
- `M5.6` only.
- Includes reliability hardening UX and final M5 gate evidence views:
  - row-level failure isolation with explicit retry affordance,
  - async guard outcomes (stale completion ignored when newer intent exists),
  - unaffected rows remain stable while one row is failing/retrying,
  - final-gate evidence view (`validate:m5` readiness) in success state.
- Excludes:
  - new map/protein/ligand control semantics beyond existing M5.5a behavior,
  - global map resets beyond existing `Hide all` / `Reset defaults` contract.

## Coverage Checklist
- [x] `Default` state: one failed row is isolated with retry available while unaffected rows remain interactive.
- [x] `Loading` state: row-level retry in progress with scoped lock on the affected row.
- [x] `Empty` state: no maps visible and no active failure/retry path.
- [x] `Error` state: retry failure remains isolated; stale async completion handling is communicated.
- [x] `Success` state: retry recovery re-enables row and includes final M5-gate evidence view.
- [x] Scope constrained to reliability hardening + final-gate readiness (`M5.6`) only.

| State | Artifact | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Default | `desktop/m5.6-reliability-final-gate-states.svg` (Panel A) | Row-level failure isolation with retry affordance present |
| Loading | `desktop/m5.6-reliability-final-gate-states.svg` (Panel B) | Row-scoped retry in progress; unaffected rows remain stable |
| Empty | `desktop/m5.6-reliability-final-gate-states.svg` (Panel C) | Zero visible maps and no active failures |
| Error | `desktop/m5.6-reliability-final-gate-states.svg` (Panel D) | Retry failure remains isolated; stale async result ignored |
| Success | `desktop/m5.6-reliability-final-gate-states.svg` (Panel E) | Retry success + final M5 gate evidence summary |

## Open UI Questions
1. None currently; this preview follows the locked M5.6 reliability/final-gate scope.

## Traceability
- Plan refs: `docs/plans/execution-plan.md` Sections `1.3`, `3`, and `3.1` (`M5.6`).
- Spec refs: `docs/specs/fragmap-controls-spec.md` Sections `10`, `11`, and `13`.

## Approval State
- Current: `BLOCKED-DESIGN` (waiting for Prompt-A artifact review and explicit `APPROVED UI PREVIEW`).
