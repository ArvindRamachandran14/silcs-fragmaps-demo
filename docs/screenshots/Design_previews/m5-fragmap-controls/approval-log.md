## Revision Notes
- 2026-02-16: Created initial M5 packet front page and M5.1 Prompt-A preview page with one multi-panel desktop SVG covering default/loading/empty/error/success.
- 2026-02-16: Added supplemental context-placement artifact (`desktop/m5.1-viewer-context-placement.svg`) to show where the M5.1 panel sits in the full viewer layout; existing state artifact retained unchanged.
- 2026-02-16: Updated M5.1 state and context artifacts to use a tabbed right-panel framework aligned to `docs/screenshots/GUI/GUI_Layout.png` (`FragMap` active; `Protein`, `Ligand`, `Components` as inactive placeholders in M5.1 scope). (Superseded by later same-day simplification.)
- 2026-02-16: Simplified the context-placement artifact tab strip to `FragMap` + `Ligand` only per reviewer feedback; state artifact remains unchanged for this revision. (Superseded by later same-day simplification.)
- 2026-02-16: Finalized alignment pass so the M5.1 state-sheet artifact also uses the simplified `FragMap` + `Ligand` two-tab framework, matching the context-placement artifact and packet docs.
