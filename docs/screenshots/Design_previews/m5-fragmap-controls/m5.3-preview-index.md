# M5.3 Preview Index - Advanced Rows + Exclusion Map

## Scope
- Slice: `M5.3 Advanced Rows + Exclusion Map`.
- Prompt type: `Prompt A` (design preview only).
- Prerequisite: `M5.2a` design and implementation gates closed.
- Runtime implementation is out of scope until explicit `APPROVED UI PREVIEW`.

## Rendering Contract (Locked for M5.3)
- FragMaps are represented as triangulated wireframe isosurfaces (polygon edges visible).
- `Exclusion Map` remains visibility-toggleable and iso-disabled.
- `Exclusion Map` uses fixed gray wireframe styling (no editable iso controls).

## Required State Coverage
- Default
- Loading
- Empty
- Error
- Success

## Planned Artifacts
- `desktop/m5.3-advanced-exclusion-wireframe-states.svg` (pending)

## Open UI Questions
- None currently. Rendering direction is locked to wireframe for all maps, including `Exclusion Map`.

## Approval State
- `BLOCKED-DESIGN` (awaiting explicit `APPROVED UI PREVIEW` for `M5.3`)
