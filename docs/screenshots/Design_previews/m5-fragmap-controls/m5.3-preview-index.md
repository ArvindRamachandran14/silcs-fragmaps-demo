# M5.3 Preview Index - Advanced Rows + Exclusion Map

## Scope
- Slice: `M5.3 Advanced Rows + Exclusion Map`.
- Prompt type: `Prompt A` (design preview only).
- Prerequisite: required flow through `M5.2b` is complete.
- Note: optional exploratory `M5.2c` parity investigation is deferred/non-blocking.
- Runtime implementation is out of scope until explicit `APPROVED UI PREVIEW`.

## Rendering Contract (Locked for M5.3)
- FragMaps are represented as triangulated wireframe isosurfaces (polygon edges visible).
- `Exclusion Map` remains visibility-toggleable and iso-disabled.
- `Exclusion Map` uses fixed gray wireframe styling (no editable iso controls).

## Required State Coverage
- [x] Default
- [x] Loading
- [x] Empty
- [x] Error
- [x] Success

## Artifacts
- `desktop/m5.3-advanced-exclusion-wireframe-states.svg` (single multi-panel Prompt-A page)

- [x] Exclusion iso shown disabled/non-editable in panel states.
- [x] Runtime implementation remains out of scope pending explicit `APPROVED UI PREVIEW`.

## Open UI Questions

## Approval State
- `PASS` (`APPROVED UI PREVIEW` received for `M5.3`; Prompt B implementation unblocked)
