# Loading State Guidance

Expected content:
- Ligand controls indicate local loading during ligand/pose update.
- Viewer remains responsive; no full-page blocking overlay.
- No route or page reload implied.

Attach artifacts:
- `../desktop/loading-state.png`
- `../mobile/loading-state.png` (if mobile variant differs)
