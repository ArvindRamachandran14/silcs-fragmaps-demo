# M4B Default State Guidance

Expected content:
- Featured quick-picks visible for a 4-entry subset (`Crystal Ligand` + 3 featured ligands).
- `Crystal Ligand` is selected by default.
- M4A controls remain unchanged (pose toggles, legend behavior, zoom action).

Artifact:
- `../desktop/m4b-default-state.svg`
