        <p>
          P38 MAP kinase is a signaling protein that helps cells respond to stress and
          inflammation, and it is a well studied drug target. In this demo we visualize the
          crystal ligand from PDB 3FLY (plus a refined pose from SILCS-MC) bound in the
          active site to give a concrete reference for how small molecules interact with the
          pocket.
        </p>

          SILCS FragMaps are 3D grids that summarize where different functional groups are
          most favorable around the protein; they act like probability and free-energy maps
          for potential binding hot spots. Overlaying FragMaps with ligands helps interpret
          why a pose is favorable and where alternative interactions might be optimized.
          Use the visualization page to toggle FragMap surfaces, switch between ligand
          poses, and adjust contour levels to explore the binding landscape.
